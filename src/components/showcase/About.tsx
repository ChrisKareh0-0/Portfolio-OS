                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                My love for technology and programming started at a young age when I received my first computer as a gift. 
                From that moment on, I was captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offered. 
                Spending countless hours tinkering with software and writing simple programs, 
                I found a sense of fulfillment and excitement that I couldn't find anywhere else. 
                As I delved deeper into the world of programming, my passion only grew stronger, 
                driving me to constantly learn and explore new technologies. 
                The ability to create something out of nothing with just a few lines of code felt like magic to me, 
                fueling my enthusiasm and determination to pursue a career in the tech industry.

                <p>
                    I started programming more seriously in high school,
                    initially with game development.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects, This is where FireLink Studios came to life 
                    {/* <a
                        rel="noreferrer"

                    . We worked on many projects together, Websites,
                    game projects, apps, and more.

                In 2023, I applied for a React Native developer position at Sync, 
                feeling somewhat lost with minimal JavaScript experience under my belt. 
                When they requested an app as part of the assessment, I turned to a friend for help. 
                Surprisingly, I was accepted, and from there, I rapidly absorbed knowledge, 
                transitioning from a novice with no real-world experience to a capable individual who could tackle tasks, 
                albeit a bit slowly, but just enough to avoid suspicion.
                As I gained more experience, I flourished, until an overseas company offered me a much better position as a Business Systems Analyst (BSA). In the team I was part of, 
                we accomplished what four entire companies before us had failed to achieve. However, this success came at a steep price â€” I found myself working 13 to 14 hours daily, 
                pushing my limits and sacrificing my health for the sake of success.
                Now, I find myself seeking a position where I can thrive comfortably and maintain a healthier work-life balance.

                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have is{' '}

                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.
